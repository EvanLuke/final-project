The program is a simple game of hangman. 
The first function will get a random word from a list of words under the 'words' variable. 

The second function will take the input from the user. It will test it to make sure it is one single lowercase letter, and if 
it has already been guessed. This function will print the amount of mistakes you have left and it will print the letters you have 
already used. 

The third function uses a While True loop, it takes the input and checks if it is in the randomly picked word. If it is it will add it to the 'board' 
if not it will add it to 'alreadyGuessed'. 

The third function also subtracts every mistake you made from a mistake variable, and checks if the mistakes are less then 1, the 
function breaks and the user will lose, and the secret word will be shown. 

The program runs until the board equals the secret word, or the amount of mistakes is less then 1.
